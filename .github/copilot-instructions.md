Don't add new files unless absolutely necessary. When I ask you to use an existing file, search the codebase because most probably the file already exists.

Use tailwind.css to provide very nice styling. Make the website look really nice and calm. Use green colors mainly.

When exporting things, always use named exports. Avoid default exports.

Whenever speaking about the contract, it's always about modifying the `public/swagger.yaml` file.

Where applicable, use `import type` instead of `import`.
